        # 5. Reinvestment modeling (if applicable)
        if self.is_reinvestment_period(period_date):
            reinvest_flows = self.reinvestment_service.project_cash_flows(period_date)
            accounts.add_reinvestment_flows(reinvest_flows)
        
        # 6. Complete waterfall execution
